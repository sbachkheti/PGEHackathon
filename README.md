# Energy A.I. Hackathon 2021

## Hosts: Prof. Michael Pyrcz and Prof. John Foster

### Architects: Honggen Jo and Mingyuan Yang

### Sponsor: Prof. Jon Olson, and the Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering

On behalf of Prof. Foster (our co-Host), Gabby, Sara, Prof. Olson (our department chair) and the Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, we welcome you to the Energy A.I. Hackathon. We are excited to host the event and we are confident that this will be a great learning experience for all!

* We will share a GitHub repository with all this information and more, including data, workshop lectures and demonstrations, etc.

More details about the UT Austin Energy A.I. Hackathon

* Great Participation: We have 19 teams of students participating (approx. 80 individuals)! Students are from various UT Austin schools, including the Cockrell School of Engineering, Jackson School of Geosciences, and the College of Natural Sciences! Hook’em!

* The Energy A.I. Hackathon Problem: a mystery dataset with a challenging subsurface prediction problem.

* The Energy A.I. Hackathon Products for Team Scoring: each team will produce:

    1. Code:  a well-documented, clean workflow in Jupyter Python (template to be provided for general formatting). Code scored for clarity and documentation / effective code comments by hackathon architects (Honggeun Jo and Mingyuan Yang).
    2. Presentation: short presentation with project goals, workflow choices and defense, results, and discussion. Scored by Judges. Strict maximum time per presentation (based on the number of teams, likely around 10 minutes).
    3. Results: a table of estimates and a set of realizations (samples) representing an uncertainty model. Must submit in the specified format for automated scoring on GitHub.
